About: GridPulser70127420_0_MATLAB (formerly known as something like filament_PS_app_20_04_24...blahblah.mlapp) is a MATLAB app written as user-facing control software to interface with the DNDO gun pulser (701-274-20 R0). It handles communication over serial UART. It manages on/off states, set points, status readback, and has basic fault detection.

The UserVariant version is for compilation via MATLAB Compiler into a stand-alone executable, and removes/hides unimplemented features so as to not confuse the user.
